## what

Bastard is a productivity helper / distraction killer written in AutoHotkey (v1.1). It takes a list of executables, checks if they exist (on a 30 second loop), and then closes them.

Itâ€™s in daily use but consider it *aplha* quality.

## how

Create file `bastard.txt` in the same folder as the script and add a list of executables, oner per line eg:

```
notepad.exe
firefox.exe
distracting_thing.exe
```

Then run `bastard.ahk`

## to do

refactor for AutoHotkey v2
