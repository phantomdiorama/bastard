## what

Bastard is a productivity helper / distraction killer written in AutoHotkey v2. It takes a list of executables, checks if they exist (on a 30 second loop), and then closes them.

**Note:** if you have to use AutoHotkey v1 go [here](https://github.com/phantomdiorama/bastard/releases)

## how

Add a list of executables to `bastard.txt`, one per line eg:

```
notepad.exe
firefox.exe
distracting_thing.exe
```

Then run `bastard.ahk`

## customisation

For a different tray icon add a file called `icon.ico` to Bastard folder.

## to do

~~Refactor for AutoHotkey v2~~
